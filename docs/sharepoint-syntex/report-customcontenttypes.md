# Libraries with custom content types

If you are already making use of content types in your SharePoint libraries, Syntex models can be used to automatically apply the correct content type to a file, and populate any metadata. Where multiple content types are used on a library, Syntex can act as an intelligent content organizer.

This page will help you to identify libraries that are enabled to use custom content types. It will also show libraries that are using the most content types.
