# Content type usage

If you are already making use of content types in your SharePoint libraries, Syntex models can be used to automatically apply the correct content type to a file, and populate any metadata.

This page will help you to identify content types that are heavily used, both by number of files and locations. Attaching a content understanding model to these widely used content types can amplify the benefit of Syntex.
